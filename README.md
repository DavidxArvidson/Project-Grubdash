# Project-Grubdash

Grubdash is an app that allows users to order from restaurants and have it delivered to them, even if the restaurant itself does not offer delivery services.

This project was developed as an assignment in the Thinkful.com engineering course. The frontend portion of this project was prebuilt while I contributed the backend code.

I used Express to build an API using RESTful API design principles that allows users to create, read, update, list, and delete dish and order data stored in databases.

The homepage of the Grubdash user interface looks like this:
